# Dev Memory System Design

## Overview
The Dev Memory system is designed to provide persistent, autonomous development context capture across the entire development lifecycle. It automatically records and organizes development activities, code changes, and user interactions to maintain a comprehensive development memory.

## Current Implementation (Dec 19, 2024)

### Core Components

1. MCP Server
- Location: `/Documents/Cline/MCP/dev-memory-server`
- Provides tools for storing and retrieving development context
- Runs as a stdio-based service through the MCP system
- Integrated with VSCode through MCP settings

2. Memory Monitor
- Location: `src/lib/core/memory/memoryMonitor.ts`
- Tracks DOM changes and user interactions
- Maintains metrics for system monitoring
- Integrates with system monitoring dashboard

3. Git Integration
- Location: `.git/hooks/post-commit`
- Automatically captures commit context
- Stores commit messages and diffs
- Runs independently of IDE/editor

### Data Organization

```
.dev-memory/
├── context/          # Project structure and patterns
├── interactions/     # Development history and user actions
└── metadata/        # System metrics and indexing
```

### Automatic Context Capture

1. Code Changes
- Git commits (messages, diffs)
- File system changes
- Code review comments

2. User Interactions
- DOM modifications
- Form submissions
- Navigation patterns

3. Development Events
- Build processes
- Test runs
- Deployment activities

## Startup & Automation

### Current Status
- MCP server must be manually started
- Git hooks require local setup
- DOM monitoring starts with application

### Planned Improvements
1. Automatic Server Startup
- Create system service for dev-memory server
- Add to startup applications
- Implement health checks and auto-restart

2. Git Hook Distribution
- Package hooks with project
- Auto-install on clone/pull
- Cross-platform compatibility

3. IDE Integration
- VSCode extension development
- Editor-agnostic monitoring
- Automated context gathering

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Health Checks
- Server status monitoring
- Memory usage tracking
- Storage optimization

### Data Management
- Automatic cleanup of old contexts
- Priority-based retention
- Compression for long-term storage

## Future Development

### Phase 1: Robustness (January 2025)
- [ ] Automated server deployment
- [ ] Cross-platform testing
- [ ] Error recovery improvements

### Phase 2: Intelligence (February 2025)
- [ ] Context relevance scoring
- [ ] Smart context pruning
- [ ] Pattern recognition

### Phase 3: Integration (March 2025)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline integration
- [ ] Team collaboration features
- [ ] External tool connectors

## Usage Notes

### Starting the Server
```bash
# From project root
cd /Documents/Cline/MCP/dev-memory-server
npm start
```

### Verifying Operation
1. Check server status:
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep dev-memory-server
   ```

2. Test context storage:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "test: verify memory capture"
   ```

3. Monitor metrics:
   - Open system monitoring dashboard
   - Check .dev-memory/metadata for logs

### Troubleshooting
1. Server Issues
   - Check MCP settings configuration
   - Verify stdio connection
   - Review error logs

2. Context Capture Problems
   - Validate Git hooks installation
   - Check file permissions
   - Monitor memory usage

## Contributing
1. Document all architectural decisions
2. Update metrics when adding features
3. Maintain cross-platform compatibility
4. Test autonomous operation
