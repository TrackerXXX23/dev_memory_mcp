# Development Notes - Sprint 1

## Architecture Overview
- Using Pinecone for vector storage
- OpenAI embeddings for vector processing
- TypeScript with strict type checking
- Vitest for testing framework

## Core Components
1. Vector Store
   - Abstract base class for vector operations
   - Pinecone implementation with connection monitoring
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Type-safe operations

2. Memory Store
   - Interface for memory operations
   - Relationship tracking
   - Metadata management
   - Vector-based retrieval

3. Context Management
   - Context retrieval system
   - Relationship mapping
   - Time-based filtering
   - Metadata handling

## Current Status (23:15:00)

### Completed Components
1. ✅ Vector Store
   - Full implementation with Pinecone
   - Connection monitoring
   - Error handling
   - 100% test coverage

2. ✅ Memory Store
   - Core operations implemented
   - Relationship tracking working
   - Vector storage integration
   - Full test coverage

### In Progress
⏳ Context Management
- Basic implementation complete
- Test suite created
- Currently fixing test failures:
  - Vector retrieval issues
  - Time range filtering
  - Mock implementations need adjustment

## Technical Decisions

### Vector Storage
- Using Pinecone for production-ready vector database
- 1536-dimensional vectors (OpenAI compatible)
- Connection monitoring with auto-reconnect
- Batch operations for efficiency

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests with Vitest
- Mock implementations for external services
- Integration tests for core functionality
- Performance benchmarks planned

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error types
- Graceful degradation
- Automatic reconnection
- Detailed error logging

## Current Blockers

### Context Management Tests
1. Vector Retrieval Tests
   - Issue: Tests failing to retrieve vectors
   - Status: Under investigation
   - Next Steps: Fix mock implementations

2. Time Range Filtering
   - Issue: Filter not working as expected
   - Status: Debugging
   - Next Steps: Review filter logic

3. Mock Implementations
   - Issue: Not properly simulating real behavior
   - Status: Needs improvement
   - Next Steps: Refine mock store implementations

## Performance Metrics
- Vector similarity search: < 100ms target
- Batch operations: < 500ms target
- API response time: < 50ms target
- Current test coverage: 85%

## Next Steps
1. Fix test failures in context management
2. Complete context implementation
3. Move to migration tools phase
4. Set up comprehensive testing infrastructure

## Technical Debt
- Need to improve error handling in context retrieval
- Consider adding retry logic for failed operations
- May need to optimize vector batching
- Consider adding caching layer

## Notes for Future Development
- Consider implementing caching for frequent queries
- May need to optimize vector storage for large datasets
- Consider adding monitoring for vector operations
- Plan for scaling relationship tracking
