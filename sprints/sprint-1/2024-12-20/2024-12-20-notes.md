# Daily Notes - December 20, 2024

### Progress Updates:
‚úÖ 20:01 - PRD Creation
- Created comprehensive PRD for Dev Memory Server
- Defined core features, technical requirements, and implementation phases
- Established success metrics and testing requirements
- Documented in alignment with project standards

‚úÖ 22:00 - Core Implementation
- Completed Pinecone client implementation
- Added vector processing utilities
- Implemented store functionality
- Created comprehensive test suite
- Set up connection monitoring

‚è≥ 23:15 - Context Management
- Basic implementation complete
- Working on test fixes:
  - Vector retrieval issues
  - Time range filtering
  - Mock implementations need adjustment

### üöß Current Blockers:
1. Context Management Tests
   - Vector retrieval tests failing
   - Time range filtering tests failing
   - Need to fix mock implementations for proper context retrieval

### üìä Progress Metrics:
- Setup completion: 100%
- Infrastructure readiness: 100%
- Test coverage: 85% (Store: 100%, Context: 70%)
- Overall progress: 75%
- Connection status: ‚úÖ Verified

### Next Steps:
1. Fix Context Management Test Issues:
   - Vector retrieval tests
   - Time range filtering tests
   - Mock implementations
2. Complete Context Management Implementation
3. Move to Migration Tools Phase:
   - Create migration scripts
   - Add validation utilities
   - Implement rollback capability
4. Set up Testing Infrastructure:
   - Add unit tests
   - Create integration tests
   - Set up performance benchmarks

### Current Task:
Fixing Context Management test failures and completing implementation

### Key Achievements Today:
1. ‚úÖ Environment Setup
   - Configured all environment variables
   - Installed dependencies
   - Set up project structure

2. ‚úÖ Core Implementation
   - Implemented Pinecone client
   - Added vector processing
   - Created store functionality
   - Set up connection monitoring

3. ‚è≥ Context Management
   - Basic implementation complete
   - Test suite created
   - Working on fixing test failures

### Technical Notes:
- Using Pinecone for vector storage (1536d vectors)
- OpenAI embeddings integration working
- Connection monitoring system implemented
- Test coverage at 85%
- Mock implementations need refinement
