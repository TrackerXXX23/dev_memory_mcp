## Current Task Status: ⏳ In Progress
Context Management Implementation - Test Fixes

## Current Step
Fixing Context Management Test Failures

## Implementation Steps
1. ✅ Create core directories and files
2. ✅ Initialize Pinecone client:
   - Set up connection configuration ✅
   - Implement error handling ✅
   - Add connection status monitoring ✅
   - Create connection test utilities ✅
   - Verify credentials and access ✅

3. ✅ Test Pinecone integration:
   - Verify connection establishment ✅
   - Test error handling scenarios ✅
   - Validate configuration settings ✅
   - Confirm index compatibility ✅
   - Verify vector operations ✅

4. ✅ Vector Processing:
   - Implement vector encoding utilities ✅
   - Add vector normalization ✅
   - Create vector batching logic ✅
   - Add vector validation ✅

5. ✅ Store Implementation:
   - Create core store interface ✅
   - Implement memory storage operations ✅
   - Add vector-based retrieval ✅
   - Set up relationship tracking ✅
   - Integrate with vector processing ✅

6. ⏳ Context Management:
   - Create context retrieval system ✅
   - Implement relationship mapping ✅
   - Fix test failures:
     - [ ] Vector retrieval tests
     - [ ] Time range filtering tests
     - [ ] Mock implementations
   - [ ] Complete implementation

## Current Blockers
1. Context Management Tests
   - Vector retrieval tests failing
   - Time range filtering tests failing
   - Need to fix mock implementations for proper context retrieval

## Next Steps After Test Fixes
1. Complete context management implementation
2. Move to Migration Tools phase
3. Set up Testing Infrastructure

## Expected Output
- Fixed context management test suite
- Properly working mock implementations
- Passing vector retrieval tests
- Working time range filtering
- Complete context management system

## Task Chain
1. ✅ Environment Setup
2. ✅ File Structure
3. ✅ Pinecone Client
4. ✅ Vector Processing
