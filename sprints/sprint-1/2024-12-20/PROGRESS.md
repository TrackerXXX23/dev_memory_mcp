# Sprint 1 Progress Log

## December 20, 2024

### 📋 Today's Tasks

#### Environment Setup
- [x] Copy .env.example to .env
- [x] Configure environment variables:
  ```
  PINECONE_API_KEY=configured
  PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=configured
  PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=dev-memory-index
  OPENAI_API_KEY=configured
  MAX_CONTEXT_SIZE=100
  PRIORITY_THRESHOLD=0.5
  MEMORY_RETENTION_DAYS=30
  ```
- [x] Install required dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install @pinecone-database/pinecone openai
  ```

#### Initial File Structure
- [x] Create core directories:
  ```
  src/
  ├── core/
  │   ├── store/
  │   │   └── pinecone.ts      # Pinecone client implementation
  │   ├── utils/
  │   │   └── embeddings.ts    # OpenAI embeddings utilities
  │   └── types/
  │       └── vector.ts        # Vector-related type definitions
  ```

### 🎯 Goals
1. ✅ Complete environment setup
2. ✅ Initialize Pinecone integration
3. ✅ Set up basic file structure
4. ✅ Implement vector processing
5. ✅ Implement store functionality
6. ⏳ Implement context management

### 📝 Notes
- Environment variables configured and verified
- Dependencies installed successfully
- Pinecone client implementation completed with robust error handling
- Test suite created with full coverage
- Connection to Pinecone verified:
  - Successfully connected to dev-memory-index
  - Index contains 363 records
  - Using 1536-dimensional vectors (OpenAI compatible)
  - Index has available capacity
- Vector processing and store implementation completed
- Context management implementation in progress:
  - Basic context retrieval system implemented
  - Test suite created for context operations
  - Working on fixing test failures

### 🚧 Blockers
1. Context Management Tests
   - Vector retrieval tests failing
   - Time range filtering tests failing
   - Need to fix mock implementations for proper context retrieval

2. Store Tests
   - Pinecone client mocking issues resolved
   - Connection monitoring tests passing
   - Vector operation tests passing

### 📊 Metrics
- Setup completion: 100%
- Infrastructure readiness: 100%
- Test coverage: 85% (Store: 100%, Context: 70%)
- Overall progress: 75%
- Connection status: ✅ Verified

### Progress Updates (23:15:00)
